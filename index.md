This project explores the potential of deep learning and statistical methods for stock market forecasting by developing models to <b>predict the future prices of the S&P 500 index</b>. Three different approaches are implemented and compared: the traditional statistical model <b>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)</b>, a <b>simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</b>, and a <b>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network</b>.
<br>
The ARIMA model serves as a baseline, capturing linear dependencies in the time series data. The RNN introduces the capability to learn temporal patterns, while the LSTM, an advanced type of RNN, excels at capturing long-term dependencies and complex non-linear patterns in the data.
<br>
After rigorous testing and evaluation, the <b>LSTM model</b> demonstrated <b>superior performance</b>, providing the most accurate predictions among the three approaches.
By comparing these diverse methodologies, the study contributes to the ongoing research in applying machine learning to financial forecasting and demonstrates the potential of advanced neural network architectures in this domain.

Credit card fraud detection is critical for financial institutions to mitigate financial losses and safeguard customers. This project aims to develop an <b>effective fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Decision Trees</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)</li>
  <li>XGBoost</li>
  <li>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</li>
</ul>
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, encompassing both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Each machine learning algorithm is trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data, assessing <b>performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score</b>.

The final outcome of the project identified the <b>Random Forest model</b> as the <b>most effective for credit card fraud detection</b>. This model demonstrated a <b>high balance between precision (0.844), recall (0.875), and F1-score (0.859), coupled with exceptionally high overall accuracy (0.9995)</b>. Its outstanding performance across these metrics positioned it as the recommended choice for practical implementation in fraud detection systems. Other models evaluated, such as XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), faced challenges either in precision or recall, highlighting Random Forest's superiority in achieving reliable and accurate fraud predictions.

The project focuses on the implementation of <b>machine learning models to predict the risk of osteoporosis</b> in patients from their medical records. They identified significant factors that influence risk, such as age, hormonal changes, medical history, lifestyle and nutrition. <b>Gradient Boosting</b> proved to be the <b>most effective model</b>, with an <b>accuracy of 92.01%</b>. This model has promising potential for early intervention and preventive strategies.
