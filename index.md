This project explores the potential of deep learning for stock market forecasting by developing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict the future prices of the S&P 500 index. The LSTM model will be compared with traditional statistical models, ARIMA and SARIMA, to evaluate its effectiveness in capturing complex patterns and making accurate predictions. The project aims to develop a robust and reliable LSTM model that can provide valuable insights for investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

The project focuses on the implementation of <b>machine learning models to predict the risk of osteoporosis</b> in patients from their medical records. They identified significant factors that influence risk, such as age, hormonal changes, medical history, lifestyle and nutrition. <b>Gradient Boosting</b> proved to be the <b>most effective model</b>, with an <b>accuracy of 92.01%</b>. This model has promising potential for early intervention and preventive strategies.
